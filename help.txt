Is a good tutorial for installing and running flask

To run the server, you must enter the virtual environment (it has Flask included in it without
you needing to install Flask on your machine is the reason why) and then simply run app.py
The tutorial above at the beginning explains 1:1 how to install virtualenv, make the virtual
environment folder, and most importantly, install Flask inside of there. Running it in
Windows is slightly different though - just run .\env\Scripts\activate

Looks like GithubPages is only good for writing static web pages. Flask is
a framework that is good for running dynamic web pages, which is what we need
for rendering charts in real time.
